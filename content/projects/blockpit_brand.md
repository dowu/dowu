## The team & my role
I am working at Blockpit since June 2018 having the chance to shape the future of the company as one of their very first employees there. From the beginning I have been responsible for the Brand & Product Design. Additionally I have been supporting our Developers with the Frontend as "CSS Guru & Mentor".

The HQ of Blockpit is located in the Tabakfabrik Linz, but there are also employees working remotely from Graz, Vienna, Munich and Kiev. As part of the core team I am working from the office in Linz.

## My usual design process
The design process needs to be compatible with the company structure and development speed, everyone would agree to that. One can't implement a highly structured design process and strategy when you should be mainly focussing on shipping features and products.

With that in mind, the design process at Blockpit needs to be as slick and agile as possible. We are mostly following the trial and error principle combined with the benefits of the core-human-centered-design process.


## Projects
As you can imagine, within the last 3 years I found myself in many different projects. Some needed more attention, some less. The largest part of my time though went in our main product: Cryptotax.

### Cryptotax
In 2020 Blockpit joined forces with the former concurrent CryptoTax, who made a similar tool. By merging CryptoTax Backend and Blockpit Frontend, a strong and versatile product was the result: Cryptotax (Yes, with lowercase "t").

### Landing page
The last major redesign of our landing page was in 2020, just before the redesign of our blog. The goal was to align our appearance visually with our product. And of course: improving the conversion and interaction drastically.

### Blog
Blogs should usually reflect the company-wide knowledge and should serve as the heart of the company's content-marketing. In my opinion blogs should also be designed to support the user at discovering new content.

With that in mind, i designed and built a completely reconsidered Blog in 2020, based on our updated Branding.

### Design System
Usually a Design System consists of two different parts: **The Styleguide** and the **Component Library**. We are mainly using a mixture of Notion and Figma for all our assets & documentation.

- **Figma**: I promise, everyone that uses Figma, falls immediately in love with it. We too. I use it for the actual designing, for simple prototyping tasks as well as to collect feedback.
- **Notion**: We use Notion mainly as a documentation tool for our Branding Guidelines. This includes the correct usage of Colors, Logos, Imagery, Iconography and Typography.

### Rebranding
When Merging the companies CryptoTax and Blockpit in 2020 we decided to create a new identity. It should transport a simplistic, serious but also modern and agile vibe.
