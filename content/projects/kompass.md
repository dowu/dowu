**Kompass is a UI component for Vue to improve both Accessibility as well as Efficiency for Power Users. I realized the project together with Frederic Köberl in Early 2021.**

## Internet vs Accessibility

Have you ever wondered why we are mainly using the Mouse as an input method while browsing through the web? Yes? 

Well it seems that Developers are building their products mainly for people who can use a mouse without thinking about people who can’t.

Studies are showing a quite similar picture. The Nucleus Research Institure, for example, found out that about [70% of all websites lack in terms of accessibility](https://accessibility.deque.com/nucleus-accessibility-research-2019). Even only 1% of the internet fits most widely used accessibility standards.

And this despite the fact that there are more than 7 million people with visual disabilities in the USA alone, according to the National Federation of the Blind.


## A Usability Framework

With Kompass we wanted to tackle this problem by providing a Usability Framework to improve the whole UX of a Product or Website by applying Ben Shneiderman’s "Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design“.

A Solution that works for both Power Users and People with disabilities, by integrating our everyday comparse in the process: the keyboard.

By hitting the keyboard shortcut `⌘ K` Kompass appears as a CLI Overlay for your Website. It contains the most important commands of the website and is completely useable via keyboard.

These commands are hierarchically structured, can be filtered by searching them and are even executable by it’s very own keyboard shortcuts. Globally.

You want to link to external pages like your Twitter profile? Open Kompass.

You want to execute simple scripts like copying a email address? Open Kompass.

You want to navigate through the pages of a website? Open Kompass.


## The Team

The team consisted of me and Frederic Köberl. While I was mainly responsible for the conceptual part and the prototyping as well as the actual designing, Frederic helped me out, to turn the idea in a solid working component.
